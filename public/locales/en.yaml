      If you select this option, your name, username, avatar and public
      profile information (website, Github, Twitter) will be visible on the
      Space homepage. Your username will be sent to Twitter, IRC and Telegram
      every time you unlock, lock or open the front door.
      If you don't select this option, you will be shown as Mystery Labber and
      your actions on the front door will still be published, but instead of
      showing your username, the text will say Someone who does not wish to be
      named, unlocked/locked/opened the door.
